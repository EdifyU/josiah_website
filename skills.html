        Hello!

         My name is Josiah Hill and I am a hobbyist coder from Dublin, Ireland. Over the past two years, I have been avidly learning how to code in Python, Html, CSS, and C#.

         Although I have worked several jobs, including ripping and uploading CDs onto a client's website for Alpha Web Solutions, I am currently working for Computers R Us in Lucan, CO. Dublin. There, I have been able to learn the following important
        skills:

         Doing both hardware and software computer repairs

         Offering technical advice

         Downloading and installing software on laptops

         Running both software and hardware tests on multiple devices.
