    <h2>Follower of Jesus - Hobbyist Coder</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Josiah Hill and I am a hobbyist coder-- which really means I type out gibberish combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols to the computer; and it outputs nice, neat websites and programmes. And I do it for fun! Over the past two
        years, I have been avidly learning how to code in Python, Html, CSS, and C#. I have worked several jobs including working for Alpha Web Solutions and Computers R Us. Apart from coding and general computer activities, I also enjoy sports, music,
        and reading (escpecially the Bible).
